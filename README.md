# odin-recipes
My second GitHub repo. The first Html project of mine from TheOdinProject.

This is just the beginning of me using Git and Github with Web Development.

Contains some recipes, describing them and telling how to make them.


Now that, I have finished making the page I can conclude that it was a fun, successful project by me. It was the first time I had created an HTML project and uploaded it to GitHub. Enjoyed the process and learned a lot during it! Most of the text is generated by Bing Chat and images are from Google.
