            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound potatoes (clean but not skinned/not new potatoes)</li>
                    <li>1 cup flour</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 medium egg (room temperature)</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil (40 grams)</li>
                    <li>2 cloves large of garlic (chopped)</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
                    <li>5 leaves basil (chopped, or 1 teaspoon/3/4 gram dried)</li>
                    <li>2 dashes hot pepper flakes (if desired)</li>
                    <li>1 can pelati tomatoes (with sauce, 1 1/2 to 2 cups/400 grams, nothing else added in the tomatoes)</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Boil the potatoes in a large pot of salted water until they are tender. Drain and let them cool enough to handle, then remove the skin.</li>
                    <li>Pass the potatoes through a potato ricer or mash them.</li>
                    <li>On a flat surface, mix together the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and add the potatoes and egg. Mix together with your fingers to form a soft dough that should not stick to your fingers.</li>
                    <li>On a lightly floured surface, cut small amounts of dough to form ropes and cut into 3/4 inch (2 cm) pieces. Then slide each piece on a fork and squeeze a little (but not too hard). Sprinkle with a little bit of flour and toss, so they donâ€™t stick together. Let the gnocchi rest for 20 minutes before cooking.</li>
                    <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic, oregano, basil, and hot pepper flakes (if using) and cook for 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Add the pelati tomatoes and water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the gnocchi to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until they float to the surface.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
                </ol>
