                    <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup olive oil, divided</li>
                    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
                    <li>28 ounce can crushed tomatoes</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning blend (or dried oregano)</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>1 pound rigatoni</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup basil, torn</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup ricotta salata, crumbled</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Trim the eggplant and partially peel them in a striped pattern (zebra pattern). Slice them into 1/2-inch rounds and sprinkle with kosher salt. Let them sit for 30 minutes to release excess water.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Brush the bottom of a large sheet pan with extra-virgin olive oil. Arrange the eggplant slices on the sheet pan in one single layer. Roast the eggplant for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
                    <li>In a large frying pan, brown the garlic with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Add a few torn basil leaves, the crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning blend, and a pinch of salt. Cook the sauce for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Cook the pasta in a pan of heavily salted boiling water for 8-10 minutes, or as per packet instructions.</li>
                    <li>Drain the pasta and add it to the tomato sauce. Add the eggplant and toss so the pasta is evenly coated in the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with crumbled ricotta salata and torn basil leaves.</li>
                </ol>
